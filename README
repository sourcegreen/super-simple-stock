Poll Application
----------------

This is the beginnings of a polling web application designed to allow a user to create a poll and then have multiple people vote on the poll. The application collects the results and produces a summary.

This project currently uses Maven to build. You can download Maven from http://maven.apache.org/ and run the compile/test with:

    $ mvn install
